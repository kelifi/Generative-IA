long_prompt = """Summarize this:An ESG report is an opportunity for an organization to provide a milestone update on progress toward environmental, sustainability and corporate governance goals. Its aim is to provide an accurate account of efforts undertaken and the expected impact of those efforts from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective with ESG data. Much like an annual report or other forms of corporate disclosure, an ESG report is a communication tool that can help an organization provide information to employees, investors and regulatory authorities.\nIn the European Union, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation came into effect in March 2021, providing requirements for ESG reporting with a focus on sustainability-related initiatives. That regulation is complemented by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into effect in January 2023. Large organizations in the U.K. are required to report using the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) framework.\nESG reporting might not be a legal requirement for all companies in every jurisdiction, but not having a report can lead to issues. A company that doesn't have an ESG report will be conspicuous in its absence, leading potential investors, consumers and employees to question its position on ESG issues.\nClimate Disclosure Standards Board Framework. The CDSB Framework was a model designed to help organizations measure the environmental side of ESG reporting. Although the framework is still used by some ESG reports, the CDSB was merged into the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation in January 2022 to create the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) alongside the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.\nStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting. The U.K. has developed its own reporting framework and guidance for ESG reporting. The SECR goes beyond reporting numbers alone to requiring that organizations provide a detailed explanation of sustainability efforts. The SECR makes use of greenhouse gas reporting standards to provide a method for reporting on carbon emissions data.\nTaskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The Financial Stability Board created the first set of recommendations from the TCFD in 2017. The TCFD approach includes four thematic areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. These areas are interrelated and supported by 11 recommended disclosures that provide information for investors and others to understand how companies evaluate and address climate-related issues.\nUnited Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. The United Nations has many reporting frameworks that are applicable to ESG; among them is the UNGPRF. The focus of the UNGPRF is on ethical governance and issues related to human rights. Alongside the UNGPRF is the complementary United Nations Global Compact, which provides guidance on helping organizations adopt sustainable practices. With this in mind, the Green Business Bureau has created a series of articles to help you get started. This ESG reporting guide will be your hubpage. Follow the steps and refer to the recommended content to understand what ESG reporting is, why it is important, and how to get started. Use the links below to navigate through this article.\nBy disclosing this information in a report, a company’s progress related to these three fields can be examined against benchmarks and targets. Once more, an ESG report is designed to provide full transparency over an organization’s environmental, social, and governance impact across a multitude of stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers.\nThis report saw its roots in Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), dating back several decades. Evolving from SRI, in 2004, UN Secretary Kofi Annan asked major financial institutions to partner with the UN and the International Finance Corporation. The aim of this partnership was to identify ways to integrate environmental, social, and governance concerns into capital markets. The resulting Who Cares Wins report was published, outlining the concept of ESG and showcasing how ESG investments made good business sense.\nTo exemplify this point, we turn to a real world example. The multinational specialty pharmaceutical company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, suffered the severe consequences of improper governance. The business misled investors by improperly accounting for revenue from mail orders. Plus, the company was found guilty of aggressive price hikes for a single diabetes drug.\nUnderstanding the importance of ESG reporting requires a mindset shift, one that doesn’t consider ESG regulation as a burden, but perceives reporting as a means of transparency. And transparency is a tool to unlock capital and create solutions for the major global challenges organizations face today (e.g. climate change, equality, and data security).\nTo demonstrate this investor shift, we turn to reports published by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The PRI is a group of investor signatories that began in 2006, supported by the United Nations. The aim was to help investors integrate ESG factors into the investment process. And so the PRI established a set of specific, voluntary, and aspirational principles for investors to follow.\nPlus, the obligation for companies to report sustainability information is also on the rise. For instance, in March 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed a new climate disclosure proposal. This now represents the broadest federally mandated corporate ESG data disclosure ever required in the US. The aim is to address climate-related risks and improve reporting consistency, quality, and comparability.\n\nBusinesses are awarded a Green Seal of Approval once they’ve completed their EcoAssessment. This is a clickable seal that will take key stakeholders to a business’s EcoProfile. Here stakeholders can view what sustainability initiatives have been successfully implemented, along with an organization’s sustainability targets. As such, this EcoProfile will support a given ESG report.\nESG criteria act as a shopping list that companies need to have on hand to attract responsible and ethical investments. These criteria are more specific and data-driven than the criteria used to assess an organization’s sustainability. This specificity might be the reason why ESG is becoming the preferred choice of phrase when thinking about purpose-driven businesses.\nThis 2020 report attempts to standardize ESG metrics and disclosures for interoperable ESG reporting. Provisional metrics and disclosures were set and put forward at the IBCs 2020 Winter Meeting in Davos. The consultation saw more than 200 companies, investors and other stakeholders provide feedback. This feedback was used to refine ESG indicators.\nBefore you get started on creating your ESG report, it’s important to decipher the difference between ESG and sustainability reporting. You need to ensure the two are separated in your business. You can then use ESG frameworks and standards to guide your business in creating a comprehensive ESG report, using the 6 steps detailed in this article to improve your ESG score. An ESG report or Sustainability report is a report published by a company or organization about environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts. It enables the company to be more transparent about the risks and opportunities it faces. It is a communication tool that plays an important role in convincing sceptical observers that the company’s actions are sincere.\nThe professional standards set forth requirements and guidance for the auditor’s involvement when other information is included in the document with audited financial statements. Sustainability reports and ESG information are often included in company reports that do not include audited financial statements. In these instances, the auditor has no responsibility for the ESG information in a financial statement audit.\nAn auditor’s report is designed to enhance the reliability of such information for the intended users of the ESG report by providing an objective and impartial assessment of the assertions, data and other disclosures made by management. Obtaining any level of assurance by the audit involves the evaluation of processes, systems, and data, as appropriate, and then assessing the findings in order to support an opinion. \n If you're reading this guide, you've probably felt the public's demands for more environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting. You might be wondering what that means for you, your organization, and changes to your reporting. Instead of treating ESG reporting as a regulatory requirement or \"nice to have,\" you have an opportunity to tell your organization's ESG story with data, build a brand reputation, and provide what investors need to make informed decisions. \n \n\n You may have seen companies publish ESG scores from organizations such as Bloomberg, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI), or others. Ratings measure the degree to which a company's economic value is at risk due to ESG factors and therefore whether a company is investable. Companies that are willing to more thoroughly report ESG performance than others tend to score higher. A lack of ESG reporting can hurt an organization's ESG score.\n \n\n Sentiment scores, which indicate the overall tone of an earnings call, tended to be higher for companies that discussed ESG factors in Q1 2020 and Q1 2021 than for those who didn't talk about ESG strategy and goals, Nasdaq said in a report that looked at Q1 2020 and 2021 earnings. \n \nThe European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which applies to financial market participants and advisors, aims to steer capital toward sustainable investments through mandated ESG reporting. The European Commission also has proposed the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to require even unlisted companies to report how sustainability issues affect their businesses, as well as how their businesses affect people and the environment. ESG reporting is the disclosure of environmental, social and corporate governance data. As with all disclosures, its purpose is to shed light on a company’s ESG activities while improving investor transparency and inspiring other organizations to do the same. Reporting is also an effective way to demonstrate that you’re meeting goals and that your ESG projects are genuine — not just greenwashing, empty promises, or lip service. \n\nSince ESG reports summarize the qualitative and quantitative benefits of a company’s ESG activities, investors can screen investments, align investments to their values, and avoid companies with the risk of environmental damage, social missteps or corruption. \n\nESG and sustainability are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are some notable differences. \n\n- Generally speaking, sustainability refers to a company’s relationship to the environment, where ESG extends that relationship to social responsibility and corruption. \n\n- ESG is an external investment framework, or a form of metrics, that helps companies communicate their initiatives and investors assess the company’s performance and risk. On the other hand, sustainability is seen as an internal framework that guides the organization’s capital investments. In other words, sustainability is the motivation, ESG is the reported outcome. \n\n- Since ESG is a reporting framework, it is more relevant to publicly traded companies looking to attract and inform investors or any other business looking to attract financing. \n\nESG aspires to be a set of disclosure standards that companies complete to communicate sustainability initiatives. Stakeholders, like investors, use ESG reports to screen their investments. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a business model where a company’s activities enhance the world around them. \n\nAs an example, US retailer, Patagonia has very strong CSR. Everything the company does is governed by its CSR. It urges conscious consumption to a point where it would sacrifice revenue for its values. Instead of pushing sales, the company offers repair services for its products, urging longevity over consumption. It resells its used products. And it actively rebels against fast fashion retail business models, ensuring its materials are sustainable and human resources are paid a living wage. \nOn June 7th, 2021, G7 finance ministers announced a commitment to mandate climate reporting in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). While a universal standard does not yet exist, ESG reporting does exist in the form of regional reporting frameworks, voluntary standards, and national legislation that vary significantly. Oftentimes, organizations will include ESG reporting into their annual reports to demonstrate how sustainable the business is.\nAs ESG has become a priority for investors and companies alike, ESG scoring aspires to grade organizations on its ESG efforts. Like a credit score or a bond rating, an ESG score denotes a company’s ability to meet its ESG commitments, its performance, and its risk exposure. \n\nAssigned by third-party providers, ESG scores are calculated based on a set of ESG metrics. Each of these agency uses a different set of criteria to score organizations. \nIn order to meet their climate objectives, the EU currently has the most established framework around ESG regulations. The strategy hinges on two pillars: \n \n1. A reimagining of incentives for financial markets and corporate governance. These are primarily covered by the Sustainable Finance Agenda and the Sustainable Corporate Governance Initiative. \n\n2. Transparency into the ESG impacts, good and bad, of an organization’s activities and their sustainability initiatives. \n\nThe latter directly involves ESG reporting, which is coming to regulatory shape through: \nThe EU Taxonomy \nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system of environmentally sustainable economic activities. The EU taxonomy aspires to provide companies, investors and policymakers with standard definitions for what’s considered environmentally sustainable. This would prevent companies from greenwashing their products or activities, incentivize sustainable activities, and funnel investments to the most sustainable organizations. \n\nThe Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation \nKnown as SFDR, this regulation defines disclosure obligations that organizations must follow to demonstrate how they consider sustainability risks in their decision making, and how they report strategy, goals, and ESG impacts to investors. This regulation came into effect in March 2021. \n\nIn the SFDR, Financial Market Participants (FMPs) must disclose 18 mandatory indicators and choose at least two more from 46 optional indicators. These indicators are based on the Principal Adverse Sustainability Impacts Statement (PAIS) and requires companies to undergo a significant amount of data analysis. \n\nNew Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) \nThe CSRD is the revised version of the EU regulation, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), a standard that laid down the disclosure rules for non-financial and diversity information by large companies. The CSRD is the tougher, revised version of the NFRD and is expected to go into effect in 2022/2023. \n\nAt the time of writing, the NFRD rules requires that all large companies and all listed companies, provide the following as minimum information:\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) is a framework that helps companies disclose both the positive and negative impact their business has on the environment, the economy, and society. GRI’s focus is on helping companies communicate their ESG impacts and how they manage these impacts. GRI is the most referenced ESG framework among all industries, receiving 83% of total references to ESG frameworks. \n\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) are a set of standards that help companies collect and share ESG data that affect the firm’s business decisions and explain the financial impact of sustainability. It’s worth noting that the GRI and SASB joined forces in 2020 and have since published a guide to how organizations can use the two standards together. GRI is known for its high-level scope, while SASB gives companies industry-specific guidelines using a financial lens. \n\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a framework that provides principles-based recommendations for managing and reporting focused primarily on climate risks. It focuses most on financial risk disclosures associated with climate to aid banks, shareholders and investors scrutinize an organization’s ESG efforts. \n\nCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an international non-profit focused on creating standards that companies can use to disclosure information pertaining to GHG emissions, water use, and forestry. This set of standards has helped companies as well as city, state and regional government organizations disclose decarbonization and environmental protection efforts. \n\nStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) is a framework created by the UK Government that guides organizations on how to report on their carbon emissions and energy usage on an annual basis. The goal of the framework is to streamline existing carbon reporting frameworks for greater transparency and comparability, while making it easier for companies to monitor and reduce their carbon emissions. \n\nThe Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) is an investor collective that formed to help companies communicate labour practices to stakeholders. It aims to improve transparency and accountability on workforce issues by providing companies with a framework for disclosing comprehensive and comparable workforce data. \nWay back in 2017, Morgan Stanley released a study that found that 86% of Millennials were interested in sustainable investing, or investing in profitable companies that operate, while having a positive social or environmental impact. The study also found that millennials were twice as likely than the overall investor population to invest in companies targeting social or environmental goals, and that 72% of Gen Z believed that responsible investing could improve sustainability outcomes. \n\nFast forward five years, it’s safe to assume sustainability has become one of the reigning priorities in the mind of the investor — and one that is very closely aligned with the investor’s perception of a company to be profitable for the long term. \n\nWith 80% of N100 firms across the globe now reporting on sustainability, a global framework for ESG is a question of when, not if. \n\nIn the coming weeks, we’ll continue to explore ESG in a blog series that will cover everything from what investors look for in ESG reports to how to improve your ESG report card. \n\nLearn how CCH Tagetik can help you streamline your ESG reporting while improving your ESG plans, contact us."""
